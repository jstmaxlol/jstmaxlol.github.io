## ⁉️what the FUCK is `motd/.jmMOTDedit/`
a ********simple******** program i made to interact with the github api and edit the MOTD from my terminal, \
if you are interested you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/jstmaxlol/jstmaxlol.github.io/blob/main/motd/.jmMOTDedit/main.cpp)
###### also yes i could have just changed the `<p>` motd tag and commit+push everytime but where's the fun then?
